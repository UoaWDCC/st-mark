  "The Graveyard of St Mark’s Church, Remuera, saw its first interment in 1849. Throughout the nineteenth century, and well into the twentieth, the graveyard became the final resting place of some 950 local residents. Some of these people are well-known historical figures who contributed significantly to the shaping of Auckland, whilst others, no less important nor less loved, have become obscured by the passing of the years. The virtual graveyard you are entering is an ongoing project to which you are welcome and encouraged to contribute. If you know something about the individuals interred at St Mark’s, or have photos or other media related to them, please let us know. Such information will allow us to develop this site, making it a treasure for generations to come.";
